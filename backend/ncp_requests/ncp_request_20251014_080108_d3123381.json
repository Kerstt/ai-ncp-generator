According to prioritization rules, this is an ACTUAL physiological problem (elimination need per Maslow's hierarchy) rather than a risk diagnosis. 'Constipation' takes priority over 'risk for constipation' because an actual problem exists. 'Chronic functional constipation' is ruled out as there is no evidence this is a chronic conditionâ€”the patient specifically states it began upon admission, indicating an acute problem. 'Perceived constipation' is inappropriate because the patient has objective evidence (bloating) and a factual 4-day history, not merely a perception. 'Dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility' is a broader diagnosis that would require additional assessment data beyond constipation symptoms. The acute constipation represents a current physiological elimination problem requiring immediate nursing intervention.",
