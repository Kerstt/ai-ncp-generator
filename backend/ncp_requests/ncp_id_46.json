Safety needs take precedence over psychosocial needs, so a safety risk outweighs the actual psychosocial diagnosis of fear. Among safety-related options, this diagnosis best captures the imminent risk of injury from falls and environmental hazards for the patient; 'risk for child falls' targets the child rather than the patient, and other options (e.g., impaired bed mobility, suffocation, pressure injury) are not supported by the data. 3) Evidence: fall risk band attached to the client, side rails down, and bed-sharing with a child increasing risk of accidental injury.",
