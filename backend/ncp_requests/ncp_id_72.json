    "diagnosis_reasoning": "1) Matches assessment: The patient has hypoactive/absent bowel sounds and no bowel movement for several days, indicating decreased/ineffective peristalsis. Contributing factors present include immobility and enteral/parenteral feeding while NPO, which are known to impair GI motility. 2) Priority rationale: No clear current airway, breathing, or circulation compromise is documented, so ABC diagnoses (e.g., impaired spontaneous ventilation, risk for aspiration) are not selected. Among physiological needs, an actual problem takes precedence over any risk diagnoses. Between two actual GI problems, dysfunctional gastrointestinal motility is prioritized over constipation because absent/hypoactive bowel sounds suggest an acute motility dysfunction (e.g., ileus) that is more urgent and upstream than simple stool retention. 3) Supporting evidence: Intubated and immobile; NPO with tube/parenteral feeding; no bowel movement for several days; hypoactive or absent bowel sounds.",
